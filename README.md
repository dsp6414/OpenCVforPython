# OpenCVforPython
a collection of python scripts to work with openCV. This collection has not been originally developed by me but it can be great sarting point for others to get to know OpenCV in Python. 

The images that are used in scripts are located in a separate folder named "images_to_test_scripts".

The numbers at the end of each folder and script help learning the concepts in a proper order.
